# Technical Animation (Spring 2021) Blog


### Introduction to Animation (2/3)

We were given a brief overview of the main topics we're covering this semester, including rigging and skinning, kinematics, motion, simulations (cloth, fluid), and body motion. Some of these concepts and even examples (i.e., the *Coco* and *Isle of Dogs* movie behind-the-scenes demos) were covered in 15-462: Computer Graphics lectures last semester. It was cool to see a more dedicated dive into the cutting-edge research in this course, and I look forward to building on top of the animation techniques I learned last semester, including forward and inverse kinematics.

### Course Overview (2/1)

We went over several new research publications in technical animation: the two that stood out to me the most were simulating boundary-aware waves and animating yarn-level cloth effects. I also liked the brief overview Prof. Pollard gave of her research on hand motion and modeling. I look forward to learning about general simulation and applications in this course, including cloth and light/fluid simulation (especially as it pertains to food)!
